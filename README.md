DATABASE SETUP:
- Setup a Firebase database, be sure to allow 'read-write' queries on the database: Change 'false' to 'true' on this line:

allow read, write: if true;

- No collections need to be initialized, the app will set these along with the document format within the database



Set up dev environment: 
- Install Expo Go app on any mobile devices for testing   https://expo.dev/
- After installing Expo Go on mobile device, launch dev server in terminal with 'npm start'
- Once loaded, scan the QR code from the terminal on the mobile device within Expo Go
- Recommend using Android Studio for additional testing   https://developer.android.com/studio
- With Android Studio, set up an appropriate mobile device emulator, start dev server, and hit 'a' in terminal to launch on emulator device


Make sure youâ€™ve included all the necessary steps someone would have to follow to set up your chat app:
Setting up the development environment (Expo, Android Studio, etc.);
Database configuration (which one, where to put database credentials, etc.);
Necessary libraries to install.
