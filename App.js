const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();  // returns an object with two properties: Navigator and Screen

// Think of a stack navigator like a pile of paper: you start with one sheet, then place a second sheet on 
// top of it, then a third sheet, and so on. To get back to the bottom of the pile, youâ€™d remove the uppermost 
// sheet of paper from your stack, then the second, and then the third. This concept is often used in app navigation.

// Stack Navigator is a type of navigator that provides a way for your app to transition between screens where each
// new screen is placed on top of a stack. The stack navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens
// where each new screen is placed on top of a stack.

// Each STACK SCREEN needs to receive two props: name and component. The name prop is a string that will be used to
// identify the screen, while the component prop is the component that will be rendered when the screen is active.

// initialRouteName prop is used to specify the initial screen that will be displayed when the navigator is first rendered.
// this can be placed on any navigator, not just the stack navigator.
